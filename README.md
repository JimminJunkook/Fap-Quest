# Fap-Quest
This is an alpha so there are probably plenty of bugs,
but I wanted to try something :3

So to execute the software you'll need to have Java installed.
If it's not the case, you can find it here (for Windows users) : https://www.java.com/fr/download/

If you're really motivated you can try to create your own opponents :
Here's a link to a tutorial : http://fap-hero.wikia.com/wiki/Create_Opponents
